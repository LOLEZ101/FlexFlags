streamed directly from Wikimedia Commons via the Special:FilePath endpoint, so
you always study the most up-to-date designs.

## Features

- 🌌 Immersive cosmic UI with responsive layouts
- 🏳️‍🌈 Universal gallery that covers 193 UN member states plus the Holy See and
  the State of Palestine
- 🔎 Instant search across every territory
